# **Fizz Buzz**

The Fizz Buzz program is my solution to the classic FizzBuzz problem done during coding interviews. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in using C++ loops.

## Project Prompt

[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!

Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.

Want to give it a shot?

![Fizz Buzz up to 5](./resources/img/fizzbuzz.gif)

Write a `fizzbuzz.cpp` program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print, FizzBuzz.

```git
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
    ...
97
98
Fizz
Buzz
```

Happy coding!

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `fizzbuzz.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ fizzbuzz.cpp -o fizzbuzz
./fizzbuzz
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ fizzbuzz.cpp -o fizzbuzz
fizzbuzz.exe
```
